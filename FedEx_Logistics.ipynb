        "### Project Summary\n",
        "\n",
        "The Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of FedEx Logistics focuses on shipment and delivery patterns, aiming to optimize operations, reduce costs, and improve efficiency. The dataset includes information on shipment modes, delivery timelines, product details, costs, and vendor data. This analysis seeks to uncover trends that will enable FedEx to streamline its logistics processes, enhance cost management, and make data-driven decisions to improve its global operations.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Analysis\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Shipment Distribution by Country**:\n",
        "   The analysis examined how shipments are distributed across different countries, identifying high-traffic regions where FedEx can potentially streamline operations, increase shipment frequency, or dedicate resources to reduce delays.\n",
        "   \n",
        "2. **Shipment Mode Usage**:\n",
        "   Air, sea, and road shipments were evaluated to understand the balance between speed and cost. The analysis provided insights into how each mode is used for different types of shipments, such as prioritizing air for urgent deliveries and road/sea for less time-sensitive items.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Freight Cost vs. Shipment Weight**:\n",
        "   A key focus was understanding how shipment weight correlates with freight costs. Identifying these patterns allows for better cost management and optimization of pricing models, leading to fairer and more accurate customer charges.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Vendor and Product Analysis**:\n",
        "   The performance of vendors and the impact of different product types on shipment volumes and costs were analyzed. This helped pinpoint key vendor partnerships and opportunities to improve relationships or negotiate better terms with suppliers who contribute more to overall shipping costs.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Findings and Recommendations\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Optimize High-Traffic Routes**:\n",
        "   Countries with the highest shipment volumes should be prioritized for route optimization. FedEx can introduce more efficient delivery lanes or consolidate shipments to reduce costs and improve delivery speeds.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Leverage Mixed Shipment Modes**:\n",
        "   To balance speed and cost, FedEx can implement a hybrid strategy. Prioritize air freight for critical deliveries but increase the use of sea and road transport for bulk shipments that are less time-sensitive, ensuring optimal resource usage and cost control.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Adjust Pricing Based on Weight Patterns**:\n",
        "   Strong correlations between shipment weight and freight costs suggest an opportunity to refine FedExâ€™s pricing models. Introducing more precise weight thresholds will allow for a more transparent and competitive pricing strategy, benefiting both the company and its customers.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Strengthen Vendor Relationships**:\n",
        "   FedEx should focus on building stronger partnerships with vendors contributing to high shipment volumes. For vendors with high costs, exploring process improvements or renegotiating contract terms could lead to cost savings.\n",
        "\n",
        "By implementing these recommendations, FedEx can improve efficiency, reduce costs, and enhance customer satisfaction, ultimately leading to stronger global logistics operations."

        "1. **Data Type Conversion:**\n",

        "\n",
        "2. **Handling Missing Values:**\n",
        "   - The **PO Sent to Vendor Date** column was removed due to a high percentage of missing values.\n",
        "   - Rows with missing values in the **Line Item Insurance (USD)** and **Shipment Mode** columns were removed, as they represented a small percentage of the data.\n",
        "   - Missing values in the **PQ First Sent to Client Date** and **Dosage** columns were filled using the mode (most frequent value) of their respective columns.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Outlier Detection:**\n",
        "   - Potential outliers for numeric columns like **Unit of Measure (Per Pack)**, **Line Item Quantity**, etc., were detected using the **interquartile range (IQR)** method. This helps identify unusual or extreme values for further investigation.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Shipment Mode and Country Analysis:**\n",
        "   - The relationship between **Shipment Mode** and **Country** was analyzed to determine which shipment modes are used in each country.\n",
        "   - A count of unique countries served by each shipment mode was provided.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Manufacturing Site and Country Analysis:**\n",
        "   - The connection between **Manufacturing Site** and **Country** was explored to identify the locations of manufacturing sites.\n",
        "   - The number of unique countries associated with each manufacturing site was calculated.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Order Counts by Country:**\n",
        "   - The number of orders (represented by unique order IDs) was calculated and sorted for each country to reveal which countries have the most and least orders.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. **Delivery Time Difference:**\n",
        "   - A new column, **Delivery Time**, was created by calculating the difference between the **Scheduled Delivery Date** and the **Delivered to Client Date**. This helps analyze delivery delays or early deliveries.\n"
