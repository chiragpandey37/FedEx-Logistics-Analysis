# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for FedEx Logistics Operations

## Project Overview

This project involves performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset related to FedEx Logistics operations. The primary goal is to derive insights into shipment management, identify potential delays, and evaluate cost-effectiveness across global supply chains. This analysis aims to help FedEx optimize delivery timelines, reduce freight costs, and improve overall customer satisfaction.

## Business Context

FedEx Logistics manages shipments globally, handling logistics operations for various industries. By analyzing shipment methods, delivery performance, vendor agreements (INCO terms), and product details, this project aims to identify inefficiencies in the supply chain and propose data-driven solutions to streamline operations. 

## Objectives

The key objectives of the project are:
1. **Understand Shipment Performance**: Analyze whether specific shipment modes (air, sea, land) influence delivery timelines.
2. **Vendor and Country-Based Insights**: Assess which vendors and countries face the highest delays and how vendor agreements impact performance.
3. **Cost Analysis**: Examine how shipment weight and other factors affect shipping and insurance costs.
4. **Visualize Trends**: Create visualizations to provide a clear understanding of key patterns and bottlenecks in the logistics process.

## Dataset

The dataset includes various attributes such as:
- Shipment Mode (air, sea, etc.)
- INCO Terms (Vendor agreements)
- Scheduled and Actual Delivery Dates
- Freight Costs and Insurance Costs
- Product Details (item description, dosage, weight)
- Destination Country
- Vendor Details

**Dataset Files**: 
- [FedEx_Logistics.csv]((https://drive.google.com/file/d/1G3sg45qaljQ9w-bB5i4-n7QAM59cR4xN/view?usp=sharing))

## Key Questions

Some of the questions this project aims to answer:
1. Are shipments managed by specific teams more likely to be delivered on time?
2. Does the shipment mode (air, sea, etc.) influence on-time delivery rates?
3. Which countries experience the most shipment delays?
4. Do higher-weight shipments incur higher insurance costs?
5. Is there a correlation between INCO terms and delivery performance?

## Tools and Libraries

This project makes use of the following Python libraries:

- **Pandas**: For data manipulation, cleaning, and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For efficient numerical computations and array handling.
- **Matplotlib**: For static visualizations (line, bar, pie charts).
- **Seaborn**: For enhanced visualizations with a focus on statistical plots.

## Key Findings

- **Shipment Mode Impact**: Shipments sent by air generally had better on-time delivery rates compared to sea shipments.
- **Vendor Performance**: Certain vendors consistently had delayed shipments, especially those with specific INCO terms.
- **Country Delays**: Shipments to countries like Vietnam and India experienced more frequent delays compared to shipments to the US or Europe.

## Visualizations

## Conclusion

The EDA of FedEx Logistics data provided several insights into shipment patterns and operational inefficiencies. These findings can help in optimizing delivery schedules and reducing costs in future operations.

## Next Steps

- Build a predictive model to forecast delivery delays.
- Analyze the impact of changes in INCO terms on vendor performance.
- Further analyze how product attributes (weight, dosage, etc.) influence costs.
